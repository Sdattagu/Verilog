As this is supposed to be used to grade a functional design that you have
already throughly tested, the more advanced test cases will not contribute
points to your score until all of the Basic test cases are 100% satisfied.
Additionally the results of the more advanced test cases will not be reported
to you until all of the Basic test cases are 100% satisfied.
