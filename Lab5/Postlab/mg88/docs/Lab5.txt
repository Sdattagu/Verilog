Lab 5 Postlab Questions

10.1 DESIGN QUESTIONS

Question:

What is the minimum amount of time that data_ready must remain asserted to ensure correct operation?
-Data_ready must be asserted for 2400000 ps in order to ensure correct operation.

What is the minimum amount of time, in clock cycles, that data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation?
-Data must remain valid for 2 cycles after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation.

Assumed that all setup and hold times, as well as any propagation delays, are negligible.

10.2 VERILOG I/O QUESTIONS 

Questions:

How are the image files different? Does this make sense given the filter design built in the lab? Why or why not?
-The filtered image is completely black. I don't think this was the correct intended operation.

What is the general syntax for each of the file IO functions used in the provided test bench (tb_fir_filter_image.sv)
-make sim_image

What are the different format specifiers available for use in file functions like $fscanf(...)?
-%f, %d, %i
