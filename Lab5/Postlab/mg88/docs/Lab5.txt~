10.1 DESIGN QUESTIONS

Question:

What is the minimum amount of time that data_ready must remain asserted to ensure correct operation?
-Data_ready must be asserted for 2400000 ps in order to ensure correct operation.

What is the minimum amount of time, in clock cycles, that data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation?
-Data must remain valid for 2 cycles after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation.

Assumed that all setup and hold times, as well as any propagation delays, are negligible.
